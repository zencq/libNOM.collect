Finally catches up with the other libNOM libraries in terms of .NET release lifecycle and NuGet Gallery and a quick fix for post-Omega compatibility.

### Added
* Now targeting up to .NET 8 as per the [.NET release lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
* Now publishing to [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/libNOM.collect)

### Fixed
* Compatibility issues with post-Omega saves (only supports those for now)
